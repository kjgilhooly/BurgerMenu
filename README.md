# BurgerMenu
Sample burger ordering system web application

This is a web-based version of a basic ordering system for a burger shop. It's based on an APL project I wrote in college, which was based on the Wendy's menu I served in high school. So, good sample code, not much else - unless you always wanted to run an online burger bar.
